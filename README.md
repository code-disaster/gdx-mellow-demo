# gdx-mellow-demo

A libGDX demo showcasing a custom shader to achieve sub-pixel perfect smooth scrolling for upscaled 2D games.

For a description, read [my blog post](http://code-disaster.com/2016/02/subpixel-perfect-smooth-scrolling.html).

The tileset used is ["Outdoor tiles, again"](http://opengameart.org/content/outdoor-tiles-again) by [Michele "Buch" Bucelli](http://opengameart.org/users/buch).
